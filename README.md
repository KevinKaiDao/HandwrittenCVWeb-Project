## Features

- Users can draw handwritten digits on a canvas within the browser interface.
- Utilizes OpenCV and TensorFlow for image processing and digit recognition.
- Provides accurate predictions of the drawn digit using a pre-trained neural network model.
- Flask framework used for backend development.
- HTML/CSS and JavaScript used for frontend development.
